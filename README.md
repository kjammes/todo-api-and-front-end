# todo-api-and-front-end
This repository contains a RESTFul API for performing all four CRUD operations.

It has simple RESTAPI which we can plug into any front-end application.
The application could we a web application or mobile application.
The only thing application has to do is target the correct paths, using right HTTP methods.
To run the API go to the RESTAPI directory and execute command 'npm start'.
You must have a working local server.
You also need to have npm and mysql installed as a pre-requisite.
Inside util/db.js file you can change username and password according to your machine.

For the front-end part I've used svelte.
To run svelte applicaiton:0
1. Navigate into todo-svelte directory.
2. Open up a terminal/cli in that directory.
3. Execute command npm run dev.
4. Open browser and go to http://localhost:5000, to see application running.
5.Play around.
